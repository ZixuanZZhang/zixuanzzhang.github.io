I am a fourth-year PhD student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/). My research focuses on developing principled methodologies and theoretical understanding in machine learning, especially deep learning.  I am interested in language models and diffusion models, with an emphasis on function approximation theory and statistical guarantees in learning applications.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned a B.S. in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
