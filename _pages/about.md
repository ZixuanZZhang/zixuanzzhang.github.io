I am a third-year PhD student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Tuo Zhao. My research focuses on deep learning theory. I am interested in function approximation and optimization theory of neural networks, as well as their statistical guarantees in learning applications. I am also interested in deep learning applications including large language models and diffusion models.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned a B.S. in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).





#A data-driven personal website
#======
#Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
