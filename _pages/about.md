I am a third-year PhD student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Tuo Zhao. My research focuses on deep learning theory. I am interested in function approximation and optimization theory of neural networks, as well as their statistical guarantees in learning applications. I am also interested in deep learning applications including large language models and diffusion models.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned a B.S. in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
